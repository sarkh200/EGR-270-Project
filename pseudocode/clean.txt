Function clean(matrix, robotPosition):

Access global variables: time and batterylife

Get the current square color under the robot:
    colorUnderBot = value at (robotPosition row and column) in matrix

If colorUnderBot is Not equal to 2:
    Set the current square to 5 (mark it as cleaned)
    Decrease batteryLife by 1
    Set colorUnderBot to 5 (indicating the square is now clean)
    Increase time by 5 units (every time the robot cleans a square)

    Return updated matrix and colorUnderBot

End Function
