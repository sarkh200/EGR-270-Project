Function findClosestPosition(currentPosition, listOfPositions):

Compute the distance between currentPosition and the first position in listOfPositions
Store this distance in lowestDistance
Set closestPos to the first position in listOfPositions

For each position from the second to the last in listOfPositions:
Compute the distance between currentPosition and the current position

If this distance is less than lowestDistance
    Update lowestDistance to this new distance
    Update closestPos to this current position

End Loop

Return closestPos as the position closest to currentPosition

End Function
