    FLOORPLAN DEFINITION:
        0 is black (can't move)
        1 is red (current robot location)
        2 is blue (charger and starting location)
        3 is brown (dirty floor)
        4 is white (regular floor)
        5 is grey (cleaned floor)

noahbot: 
    Variables needed:
     *Prompt for matrix (outside function)
     *record bot position (inside function)
     *Charger (starting position and return position) (inside function)
     starting position = charger position

    Robot
        while loop (iterates till either whole floor is cleaned or till bot runs low on battery)
            look up if position(i+1, ) == 0||5
                if false move bot to new location
            look right if  position( , i+1) == 0||5
            look down if position( i-1, ) ==0||5
            look left if position( , i -1) ==0||5
        end

    Movement    
        *Record previous position with an increasing value by 1. to keep track of most recently cleaned floors.
        In order to back track to position of battery death.
        *When battery dies A* back to charger. Then take advantage of cleaned flors system.
        
Order of Precedence (loop)
    1. Brown (3)
    2. White (4)
    3. grey (5:i+1)
    4. Black (0)
